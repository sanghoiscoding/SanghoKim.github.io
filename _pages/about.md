Hi, I'm Sangho, a sophomore student at SunKyunKwan University in South Korea.

I major in **Computer Science & Engineering**(CSE) with a triple degree
on **Artificial Intelligence**(AI), and **Political Science & International Relations**(PSIR).

Note: I will be heading to Austin, TX for my Exchange year at the University of Texas at Austin Computer Science department, starting from Fall 2025 to Spring 2026.

I'm currently doing research at [Pixel Lab](https://sites.google.com/view/pixel-lab-ai/home?authuser=0), advised by [Prof. Sangmin Lee](https://sites.google.com/view/sangmin-lee/home).

**My research domains** are as follows:

1. Multi-modal Representation Learning and Reasoning
2. Multi-party Social Interaction Understanding
3. Artificial Social Intelligence (ASI)

Previously, I interned at [Code Lab](https://codelab.snu.ac.kr/) @ Seoul National University Graduate School of Data Science, advised by [Prof. Hyojin Sung](https://codelab.snu.ac.kr/people) during my freshman year.

I'm the founder of SKKAI(SungKyunKwan AI), the unversity's frist Student AI Association bridging interdisciplinary majors, covering Low-level to High-level AI. Before that, I participated in the Natural Language Processing, and Computer Vision sessions.

I'm also an ex-Staff Sergeant from R.O.K. Air Force Operations Command Systems branch(Comms), where I worked closely with the United States 7th Air Force, at Osan Air Base. My proposals there were highly recognized by the R.O.K. Chief of Command and Palantir technologies.
