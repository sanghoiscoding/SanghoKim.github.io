Hi, I'm Sangho, a sophomore student at SunKyunKwan University in South Korea.

I major in **Computer Science & Engineering**(CSE) with a triple degree
on **Artificial Intelligence**(AI), and **Political Science & International Relations**(PSIR).

Note: I will be heading to Austin, TX for my Exchange year at the University of Texas at Austin Computer Science department, starting from Fall 2025 to Spring 2026.

I'm currently doing research at [Pixel Lab](https://sites.google.com/view/pixel-lab-ai/home?authuser=0), advised by [Prof. Sangmin Lee](https://sites.google.com/view/sangmin-lee/home).

**My research domains** are as follows:

1. Multi-modal Representation Learning and Reasoning
2. Multi-party Social Interaction Understanding
3. Artificial Social Intelligence (ASI)

Previously, I interned at [Code Lab](https://codelab.snu.ac.kr/) @ Seoul National University Graduate School of Data Science, advised by [Prof. Hyojin Sung](https://codelab.snu.ac.kr/people) during my freshman year.

I'm also the Founder of SKKAI(SungKyunKwan AI), the unversity's one-and-only Student AI Association. Before that, I participated in the NLP, and Computer Vision session.

I'm also a ex-Staff Sergeant from R.O.K. Air Force Operations Command Systems branch(Comms), where I worked with the United States 7th Air Force, at Osan Air Base. My proposals there were recognized by the Chief of Command and Palantir tech.
