Hi, I'm Sangho Kim, a sophomore student at SunKyunKwan University, advised by [Prof. Sangmin Lee](https://sites.google.com/view/sangmin-lee/home)).

I'm moving to Austin, TX for my Exchange year at UT Austin CS department, starting from Fall 2025 to Spring 2026.

I major in Computer Science & Engineering with a triple degree on
Artificial Intelligence, Political Science & International Relations in both campus.

I'm the Founder of SKKAI, 19th president of former TNT.
Before that, I participated in the NLP session (Freshman & Military - Spring 2024),
and Basic CV session (Sophomore, Team Lead - Fall 2024)

Currently I’m doing my research on ‘Artificial Social Intelligence’

Before that, I ended my research opportunity where I did my research on ‘AI Acceleration’

I’m going on exchange to the University of Texas at Austin for a year,
starting this Fall 2025. I won’t be in Korea until June 2026.
